# testing
A place to practice testing on github.

Making changes to push to my forked versions.

Now I need practice. 
You really do.

Looks like I'm getting the hang of things. 
And now we add a link like so....

I removed a line, and added a line. I want to practice command line git commands from a branch.


I think this file is now done.  I've got a link added. We're good to go.
